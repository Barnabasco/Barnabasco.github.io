## Project Overview:
Led a data-driven initiative to enhance patient outcomes by analyzing 250,000+ healthcare records using SQL, Excel, and Power BI. Identified correlations between treatment protocols and recovery rates, resulting in 18% improvement in patient outcomes across key metrics.

## Technical Approach
```sql
-- Treatment efficacy analysis
SELECT 
    treatment_type,
    AVG(recovery_days) AS avg_recovery,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN readmission_30d = 1 THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) AS readmission_rate,
    CORR(patient_age, recovery_days) AS age_correlation
FROM patient_records
WHERE discharge_date > '2022-01-01'
GROUP BY treatment_type
ORDER BY avg_recovery;
```
```python
# Outcome prediction model
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

features = ['age', 'treatment_type', 'comorbidity_index', 'treatment_duration']
target = 'recovery_status'

model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
model.fit(X_train[features], y_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_test[features])
```
## Key Insights
Treatment Efficacy Dashboard
Interactive Power BI dashboard showing recovery rates by treatment type

* Demographic trends: Patients 65+ showed 32% longer recovery times
* Treatment efficacy: Protocol B reduced readmissions by 24% vs standard care
* Cost impact: Optimal treatment pathways saved $2.3M annually

## Impact

| Metric                  |	Before	| After	| Improvement |
|-------------------------|---------|-------|-------------|
| 30-day readmission rate |	15.2%   |	11.6%	| â†“ 23.7%     |
| Avg. recovery days      |	8.7     |	7.1   |	â†“ 18.4%     |
| Patient satisfaction	  | 82%	    | 91%	  | â†‘ 11%       |


## Implementation

### Healthcare Data Pipeline Architecture

**Data Flow:**
1. ðŸ“¥ Extraction: Pull from EMR Systems  
   *Tools: SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)*
2. ðŸ’¾ Storage: SQL Server Database  
   *Features: ACID compliance, Daily backups*
3. ðŸ§¹ Cleansing: Standardization & Validation  
   *Processes: Deduplication, Null handling*
4. ðŸ§  Analysis: Predictive Models  
   *Techniques: Random Forest, Logistic Regression*
5. ðŸ“Š Visualization: Power BI Dashboards  
   *Components: Treatment efficacy, Recovery trends*
6. ðŸ©º Consumption: Clinical Teams  
   *Usage: Daily decision support*


## Clinical Recommendations:

* Standardize Protocol for selected group of patients

* Implement geriatric care pathways for patients 70+ 

* Adjust staffing based on treatment demand patterns
